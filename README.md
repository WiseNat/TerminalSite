# TerminalSite

This is my first attempt at a proper website. It's basically just an interactive, modular version of my CV.

The major systems it boasts are:
1. Custom terminal-like environment
2. Safe file navigation
3. Terminal themes


It should be fairly easy to modify the site to add new terminal themes and new files. Adding new commands is more complicated but not too difficult.
