# TerminalSite

This is my first attempt at a proper website. It's basically just an interactive, modular version of my CV.

The major systems it boasts are:
1. Custom terminal-like environment
2. Safe file navigation
3. Terminal themes


It should be fairly easy to modify the site to add new terminal themes and new files. Adding new commands is more complicated but not too difficult.


If the terminal locks up and you're unable to delete anything, please chuck me an issue detailing the exact commands you used and even better steps to reproduce if you can. Usually this happens because of a difference between the HTML strings in memory compared with the site's actual HTML.
