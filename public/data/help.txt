Alright. You're stuck. The thing is though, you managed to make it to
this file. Surely this means you're smart enough to navigate the rest
of the site?

If not then I'll give you some tips.

Run "HELP" to get a list of commands and then "HELP command" for info
on that command. For example "HELP cd" is always a good start. You
also don't have to worry about caps at all. Try "hELp cD" if you
want.

The "TREE", "DIR" and "CD" commands are the most useful. I'd
recommend learning how these all work. Try the following list of
commands if they're still confusing you:

TREE
CD Education
DIR
CD ..
DIR
TREE Education
DIR

The rest is a lot easier so I'll leave that to you to figure out.
Good luck.
