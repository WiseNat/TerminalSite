For my A-level computer science coursework, I made a remote
controlled camera that is controlled with an Android app. This app
can contro the camera on a multi-axis servo mount linked up to a
Raspberry Pi 4B. 

The features the app provides are:
• Pitch and Yaw servo rotation
• Face Detection servo rotation
• Take photo - sends the photo to the users phone
• Timed photo - waits a set amount of time before taking a photo
• Share latest photo
• Open photo gallery
