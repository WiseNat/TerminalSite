For 3 months, I lead-developed a Discord bot for alwaysAI. This bot
allows users to run alwaysAIâ€™s deep vision models from within
Discord. It can also search the documentation and view model
information using the bot.

A blog post about it from alwaysAI was created at:
https://alwaysai.co/blog/computer-vision-alwaysai-discord-bot-creators.

The GitHub repository can be viewed here:
