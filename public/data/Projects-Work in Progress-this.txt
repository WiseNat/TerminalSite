Well, what you're currently looking at is still a work in progress.
There's a lot of things to do still listed on the Trello and I
probably won't get through all of them because there's some fairly

• Stopping it send that Error 404 with fetch
• Dynamically generating dir_structure.json
• Resolving losing connection
• Terminal themes
• Cookies for those terminal themes
• Mobile support
• Larger browser support (except EI. Nobody likes EI)
• Markdown for this thing right here. Currently it's only text based
