Well, this is technically a finished project at the end of the day.

Sure I could add some more features like:
• Custom terminal theme
• Proper Markdown support for files
• Image files (ASCII char output generated using the image)
• Bug report command
• Feedback command

Wait... that last one is actually a good idea. Maybe I'll do that
soon.

The thing is though, I still classify this project as finished
because it met all of the requirements I set it out to meet.

So yeah, hope you're enjoying this thing so far.
Also, Konami is nice.
